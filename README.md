# Daily Planner

# Description
The Daily Planner Application uses HTML, CSS, and, primarily, JavaScript to create a daily planner that depends on the local storage of one's web browser to allow the user to add text that would serve as daily events within the hour blocks.  Upon clicking the save button, the users text is saved in the text box and the user will be able to refresh or reopen the page and find their event still there.  This project was done in collaboration with Mark Loercher, Eliezer Pagan, and Fayaz Lalani. Starter code was provided by Columbia Coding Bootcamp.
